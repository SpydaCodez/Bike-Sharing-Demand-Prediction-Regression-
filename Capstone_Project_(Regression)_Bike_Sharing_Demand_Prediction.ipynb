        "The emergence of bike and scooter ride-sharing companies in urban areas, has created a challenge in accurately predicting the demand for their services. Overestimating or underestimating the demand can lead to resource wastage or revenue loss, respectively. To address this challenge, this project aims towards combining historical bike usage patterns with weather data to forecast bike rental demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project utilizes a dataset with eight input variables: 'Date', 'Seasons', 'Holiday', 'Functional day', 'Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Dew Point Temperature', and 'Windspeed'. Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, and scikit-learn (sklearn) are used to develop the prediction algorithm. By evaluating different models, the project seeks to identify algorithms that provide accurate predictions and can be deployed effectively in real-world scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "Accurate bike rental demand forecasting offers significant benefits. Ride-sharing companies can reduce waste and improve resource allocation, resulting in cost savings and increased profitability. By optimizing bike maintenance, parking space allocation, and operational planning based on anticipated demand, these companies can operate more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, accurate demand predictions enhance customer satisfaction and provide a better overall experience for users. By ensuring an adequate supply of bikes and scooters based on anticipated demand, customers are less likely to face unavailability issues. This fosters customer loyalty, positive word-of-mouth, and sustained business growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, bike and scooter ride-sharing services are considered environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional transportation methods. By incorporating weather data into demand forecasting, it becomes possible to align the supply of bikes and scooters with weather conditions suitable for cycling. This encourages more people to choose biking as a means of transportation, resulting in reduced traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions. Accurate demand forecasting contributes to the broader goal of promoting sustainable and eco-friendly urban mobility.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, this project's aim is to combine historical bike usage patterns with weather data for accurate demand forecasting holds significant potential for the bike and scooter ride-sharing industry. By utilizing advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, the project seeks to optimize resource allocation, reduce waste, and increase profitability for ride-sharing companies. Simultaneously, it strives to enhance customer satisfaction, promote environmentally friendly transportation alternatives, and mitigate traffic congestion and carbon emissions. Data-driven insights can have a positive impact on both the business and environmental aspects of the bike and scooter ride-sharing industry, leading to a more sustainable and efficient urban mobility landscape."

This implies that there is a significant relationship between these independent variables and the 'Rented Bike Count'. However, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis for the 'Solar_Radiation' and 'Snowfall' variables, indicating that these variables may not have a significant relationship with the 'Rented Bike Count'."

We started by examining the dependent variable, 'Rented Bike Count,' and made necessary transformations to ensure its suitability for modeling. Moving on, we focused on the categorical variables and eliminated those with a dominant single class. For the numerical variables, we calculated correlations, studied their distributions, and analyzed their relationships with the dependent variable. Additionally, we removed numerical features mostly consisting of 0 values and performed one-hot encoding for the categorical variables.\n",
